JWT authentication flow

backend:

1. Register

POST /v1/register

- Hash the password before storing it in the database.
- Create the user and store it.
- Generate a JWT token (sign with a secret key, including claims like user_id, role, exp)
- Return the JWT to the frontend in the response

2. Login

POST /v1/login

- Verify credentials (check email & hashed password match).
- Generate a new JWT for the user.
- Return the JWT token to the frontend.

3. Auth middleware

For protected routes

- Read JWT from Authorization header.
- Verify token signature and expiration.
- Extract user_id and role from claims

frontend:

1. Register

2. Login

save JWT to local storage

include JWT in Authorization header for every protected route

3. Logout

remove jwt from local storage

localStorage.removeItem("jwt");
